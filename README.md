# VRPTW-Projet

## Overview
VRPTW-Projet is a Java application developed to calculate optimized itineraries that minimize distances in Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The project leverages Tabu Search and Genetic Optimization algorithms to find efficient routes. This project was developed by a team of two.

## Features
- Tabu Search Algorithm: Implements Tabu Search for route optimization.
- Genetic Optimization Algorithm: Utilizes genetic algorithms to further optimize routes.
- Distance Minimization: Focuses on minimizing total travel distance while respecting time windows.
